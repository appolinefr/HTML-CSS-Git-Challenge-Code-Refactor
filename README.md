# HTML-CSS-Git-Challenge-Code-Refactor

## Description 

This week's challenge was to take existing code and refactor it in order to make the existing site more accessible.

The main acceptance criteria were as follow:
- make sure to have semantic HTML elements
- ensure that the elements follow a logical structure independent
- include accessible alt attributes as well as a concise, descriptive title
- organise and consolidate CSS elements and properties 
- deploy the page on github

This homework was overall not as challenging as expected as most of the content was covered during the classes. Deploying the page was a little overwhelming as this was not practised in class.
